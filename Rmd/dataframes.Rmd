## What are data frames?

Data frames are tables that hold data that consist of __rows__ and __columns__, just like a spreadsheet. They are most likely the primary way you will access, manipulate and plot your data from while using R.

R includes a series of included data sets that you can find in the datasets library. Type `library(help='datasets')` to see a list of what is there. To get started we'll use the __mtcars__ dataset, which you can find out about by typing `?mtcars`.

> The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

Load the data into your workspace with `data(mtcars)`

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)   # this will show you the first 6 rows by default
```

Data frames are tables like a spreadsheet where rows are 'observations' (e.g. subjects, trials, messages) and columns are 'variables' (e.g. measured characteristics, features)

You can also see the whole data by typing `mtcars`. `head` and `tail` will give you the first and last __n__ rows, e.g.

```{r}
head(mtcars,3)  # first three rows
```

```{r}
tail(mtcars,3)  # last three rows
```

### Get the names of the columns in a dataframe

```{r}
colnames(mtcars)
```

### Get the values from a single column

1. by name

```{r}
mtcars$wt
```

2. by using indexing with the syntax <code>DF[row, column]</code> - indexing starts from 1 and leaving either 'row' or 'column' blank will get all values in that row or column

```{r}
mtcars[,1]  # gets the first column
```

which is the same as

```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```

ranges of rows or columns can be specified as:

* continous ranges, e.g. `df[1:5,]` means rows 1,2,3,4&5
* specific indices using c(), e.g. `df[c(1,3,5,11),]` means rows 1,3,5 & 11
* by a combination e.g., `df[c(1:3,7,11,15),]` means rows 1,2,3,7,11&15
* by column or rowname, e.g. `df[,c('mpg','wt)]` means columns 'mpg' and 'wt'


```{r}
mtcars[1:5,5] # get the data from the fifth column for the first five rows
```

* Combining more than one row and more than one column when indexing a data frame will return another data frame. For example, this will get the __mpg__ and __wt__ columns for the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th rows of the __mtcars__ data frame.


```{r}
mtcars[c(3,5,7,9),c('mpg','wt')]
```


## Summarizing columns in data frame

#### 1. Specific columns:

```{r}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```


```{r}
summary(mtcars$gear)
```


#### 2. All columns in data frame:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Plotting summary data

#### 1. Histogram

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

#### 2. Pair scatter plot - if your columns are all numeric or categorical you can do a pairwise plot

```{r}
plot(mtcars)
```

## Plotting relationships between variables

#### 1. using plot(x,y) and specifying each column

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```

#### 2. using with()

```{r}
with(mtcars, plot(wt, mpg))
```

#### 3. using formula syntax - ``plot(y ~ x, data_frame)``

```{r}
plot(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
```

## Correlations

- ``cor`` will calculate correlation between pairs of vectors

```{r}
cor(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
with(mtcars, cor(wt, mpg))
```

- can also do ranges, e.g. ``cor(mtcars[,1:4])`` which does pairwise correlations of the first four columns of the data frame

```{r}
cor(mtcars[,1:4])
```

- or you can use the other methods of indexing discussed above

```{r}
cor(mtcars[,c('wt','mpg','cyl','disp')])
```

- if you just provide the dataframe all numeric columns will be correlated in pair wise fashion

```{r}
cor(mtcars)
```


## Linear regresson

#### Fit a simple regression

Using the same formula syntax ``DV ~ IV`` used above for plots

```{r}
md <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)

summary(md)
```


#### Fit a multiple regression 

Use ``+`` to add additional IVs

```{r}
md2 <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, mtcars)

summary(md2)
```

#### Examine an interaction

Use ``*`` to interact two IVs

```{r}
md3 <- lm(mpg ~ wt * cyl, mtcars)

summary(md3)
```

#### Compare models 

The ``anova`` function takes two or more fitted models and does an F-test

```{r}

anova(md,md2,md3)

```

#### Add a regression line to a plot

```{r}

plot(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
abline(md, col='red')

```


## Aggregating data by a categorical variable

Often you will have a grouping or factor variable and want to use that to summarize
other variables by. For example, in the __mtcars__ data frame the cylinder (cyl) variable could be used to group the other variables to calculate the mean.

Here we can get the mean weight for cars with 4, 6 and 8 cylinders. 

```{r}

aggregate(wt ~ cyl, mtcars, mean)    # formula, data_frame, summary function

```

Here we get the standard deviation of miles per gallon grouped by cylinders

```{r}

aggregate(mpg ~ cyl, mtcars, sd)

```

You can also get two or more groupings using the ``+`` syntax in the formula. For example, get the mean of MPG crossed by cylinders and number of gears:

```{r}

aggregate(mpg ~ cyl + gear, mtcars, mean)

```

```{r}

aggregate(cbind(mpg, wt, disp) ~ cyl + gear, mtcars, mean)

```
